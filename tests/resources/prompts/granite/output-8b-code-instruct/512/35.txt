Question:
Implement a Python function that applies dynamic quantization to a pre-trained transformer model (such as BERT or GPT) in PyTorch, and compares the model size and inference speed before and after quantization.


Answer:
Here's how you can implement dynamic quantization in PyTorch:

```python
import torch

def dynamic_quantization(model):
    model.qconfig = torch.quantization.get_default_qconfig('fbgemm')
    torch.quantization.prepare(model)
    model.eval()
    with torch.no_grad():
        for _ in range(10):
            model(torch.randn(1, 32))
    torch.quantization.convert(model)
```

This function applies dynamic quantization to a pre-trained transformer model in PyTorch. It sets the quantization configuration to `fbgemm`, prepares the model for quantization, evaluates the model, runs inference for 10 iterations, and converts the model to a quantized version.<|endoftext|>
