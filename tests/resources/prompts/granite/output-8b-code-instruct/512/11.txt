Question:
Write a function in JavaScript that debounces an input function such that it's only called once, after the input has stopped being called for a specific delay (e.g., for implementing searc bar auto-suggestions).


Answer:
Here's how you can implement this function:

```javascript
function debounce(func, delay) {
  let timeoutId;

  return function(...args) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => func(...args), delay);
  };
}
