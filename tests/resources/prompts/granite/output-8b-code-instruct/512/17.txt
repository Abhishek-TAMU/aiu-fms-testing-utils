Question:
Write a Rust program that reads a file line by line and prints each line reversed. Handle possible errors using Rust's `Result` and `Option` types.


Answer:
```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, BufRead};

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    let file = File::open("input.txt")?;
    let lines = io::BufReader::new(file).lines();

    for line in lines {
        let line = line?;
        let reversed = line.chars().rev().collect::<String>();
        println!("{}", reversed);
    }

    Ok(())
}
