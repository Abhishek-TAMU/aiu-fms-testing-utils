Question:
Write a Python function using `multiprocessing` that calculates the sum of squares of a large list of integers in parallel.


Answer:
Here's how you can implement this:

```python
import multiprocessing

def square_and_sum(numbers):
    return sum(x ** 2 for x in numbers)

def parallel_sum_of_squares(numbers):
    with multiprocessing.Pool() as pool:
        return sum(pool.map(square_and_sum, [numbers[i:i+1000] for i in range(0, len(numbers), 1000)]))
