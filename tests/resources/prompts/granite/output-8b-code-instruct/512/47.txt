Solve the following coding problem. Wrap your code answer using ```


Question:
Write a program in Rust that implements a simple producer-consumer problem using channels, where multiple producers send data to a consumer that processes it asynchronously.


Answer:
```rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::mpsc;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

    let producer_thread = thread::spawn(move || {
        tx.send(1).unwrap();
        tx.send(2).unwrap();
        tx.send(3).unwrap();
    });

    let consumer_thread = thread::spawn(move || {
        for msg in rx {
            println!("Received: {}", msg);
        }
    });

    producer_thread.join().unwrap();
    consumer_thread.join().unwrap();
}
