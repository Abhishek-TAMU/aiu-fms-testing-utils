Question:
Write a SQL query that groups customers by country and calculates the average order value per country using data from a `customers` and an `orders` table.


Answer:
Here's an example SQL query that groups customers by country and calculates the average order value per country:

```sql
SELECT
    c.country,
    AVG(o.order_value) AS avg_order_value
FROM
    customers c
JOIN
    orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY
    c.country;
```

This query joins the `customers` and `orders` tables on the `customer_id` column and groups the results by country using the `GROUP BY` clause. The `AVG` function is used to calculate the average order value per country.<|endoftext|>
