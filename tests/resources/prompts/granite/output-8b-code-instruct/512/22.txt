Question:
Write a Bash script that recursively searches for all files larger than 100MB within a given directory and moves them to a separate folder called `large_files`.


Answer:
Here's a Bash script that recursively searches for all files larger than 100MB within a given directory and moves them to a separate folder called `large_files`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the directory to search
directory="/path/to/search"

# Create the large_files directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p large_files

# Find all files larger than 100MB and move them to the large_files directory
find "$directory" -type f -size +100M -exec mv {} large_files \;
```

This script uses the `find` command to search for all files in the specified directory and its subdirectories that are larger than 100MB. The `-type f` option ensures that only files are considered, and the `-size +100M` option specifies the file size threshold. The `-exec` option is used to execute the `mv` command to move each file to the `large_files` directory. The `{}` placeholder is replaced with the name of each file that matches the search criteria.<|endoftext|>
