Question:
Implement a Python function using `asyncio` to make multiple asynchronous web requests and return the first successful response, cancelling the rest.


Answer:
Here's how you can implement this:

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def make_requests(urls):
    tasks = [asyncio.ensure_future(request(url)) for url in urls]
    responses = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    for response in responses:
        if isinstance(response, aiohttp.ClientResponse):
            return response
    return None

async def request(url):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(url) as response:
            return response
