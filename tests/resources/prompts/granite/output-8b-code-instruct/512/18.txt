Question:
Create a Bash script that compresses all `.txt` files in a directory into a `.zip` file, but excludes files that are larger than 1MB.


Answer:
Here's a Bash script that compresses all `.txt` files in a directory into a `.zip` file, but excludes files that are larger than 1MB:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set the directory to compress
directory="/path/to/directory"

# Create a temporary directory to store the compressed files
temp_dir=$(mktemp -d)

# Loop through all .txt files in the directory
for file in $directory/*.txt; do
    # Check if the file is larger than 1MB
    if [[ $(wc -c < "$file") -le 1048576 ]]; then
        # Compress the file and store it in the temporary directory
        zip -j "$temp_dir/$(basename "$file").zip" "$file"
    fi
done

# Create a .zip file containing all compressed files
zip -r "$directory/compressed_files.zip" "$temp_dir"

# Remove the temporary directory
rm -rf "$temp_dir"
```

This script uses a temporary directory to store the compressed files. It loops through all `.txt` files in the specified directory, checks if the file is larger than 1MB, and compresses it using the `zip` command. Finally, it creates a `.zip` file containing all compressed files and removes the temporary directory.<|endoftext|>
