Question:
Write a SQL query that finds all customers who made purchases in both the years 2023 and 2024, using a `customers` table and a `purchases` table with `purchase_date`.


Answer:
Here's how you can write the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT c.*
FROM customers c
JOIN purchases p ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
WHERE p.purchase_date >= '2023-01-01' AND p.purchase_date < '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY c.customer_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT YEAR(p.purchase_date)) = 2;
