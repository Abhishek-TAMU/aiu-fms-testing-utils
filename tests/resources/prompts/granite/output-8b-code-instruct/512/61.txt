Question:
Write a Python context manager class using `__enter__()` and `__exit()__` that measures the execution time of the code block within the context and prints the duration when exiting the block.


Answer:
Here's how you can implement a context manager class that measures the execution time of the code block within the context and prints the duration when exiting the block:

```python
import time

class ExecutionTimer:
    def __enter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        end_time = time.time()
        duration = end_time - self.start_time
        print(f"Execution time: {duration} seconds")
