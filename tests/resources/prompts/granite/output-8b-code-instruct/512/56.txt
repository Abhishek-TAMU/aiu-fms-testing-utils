Question:
Write a Python program that uses the `multiprocessing` library to create a pool of worker processes that calculate the factorial of numbers in a large list concurrently.


Answer:
Here's how you can implement this:

```python
import multiprocessing

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

def calculate_factorial(numbers):
    pool = multiprocessing.Pool()
    results = pool.map(factorial, numbers)
    pool.close()
    pool.join()
    return results
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
results = calculate_factorial(numbers)
print(results)
```

This implementation uses the `multiprocessing` library to create a pool of worker processes that calculate the factorial of numbers in a large list concurrently. The `calculate_factorial` function creates a pool of worker processes using `multiprocessing.Pool()`, and then uses the `map` function to apply the `factorial` function to each number in the list. The `pool.close()` and `pool.join()` methods are used to close the pool and wait for all worker processes to finish. Finally, the results are returned and printed.<|endoftext|>
