Question:
Write a SQL query that joins two tables, `orders` and `customers`, and retrieves the top 5 customers who have placed the highest number of orders in the past year.


Answer:
Here's an example SQL query that joins the `orders` and `customers` tables and retrieves the top 5 customers who have placed the highest number of orders in the past year:

```sql
SELECT c.name, COUNT(o.order_id) AS num_orders
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_date >= DATEADD(year, -1, GETDATE())
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name
ORDER BY num_orders DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

This query joins the `orders` and `customers` tables on the `customer_id` column. It then filters the results to only include orders placed in the past year using the `WHERE` clause. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by customer and calculates the number of orders placed by each customer. The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results in descending order based on the number of orders. Finally, the `LIMIT` clause limits the results to the top 5 customers.<|endoftext|>
