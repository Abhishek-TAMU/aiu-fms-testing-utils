Question:
Write a SQL query to find the second highest salary in an `employees` table, where each row contains an employee's `id`, `name`, and `salary`.


Answer:
Here is the SQL query to find the second highest salary in an `employees` table:

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) AS second_highest_salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);
```

This query uses a subquery to find the maximum salary in the `employees` table, and then selects the maximum salary that is less than the maximum salary found in the subquery. This will give you the second highest salary in the `employees` table.<|endoftext|>
