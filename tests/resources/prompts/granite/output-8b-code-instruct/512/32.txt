Question:
Build a Python function that creates an inference pipeline for a transformer model using the HuggingFace `pipeline()` API, The function should classify input text into one of several predefined categories.


Answer:
Here's how you can implement this:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

def create_inference_pipeline(model_name, num_labels):
    classifier = pipeline(
        "text-classification",
        model=model_name,
        tokenizer=model_name,
        num_labels=num_labels
    )
    return classifier
