Question:
Write a Bash script that recursively searches for all files larger than 100MB within a given directory and moves them to a separate folder called `large_files`.


Answer:
Here's a Bash script that recursively searches for all files larger than 100MB within a given directory and moves them to a separate folder called `large_files`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set the directory to search in
directory="/path/to/search"

# Create the large_files directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p large_files

# Search for files larger than 100MB and move them to the large_files directory
find $directory -type f -size +100M -exec mv {} large_files \;
```

This script uses the `find` command to search for files in the specified directory and its subdirectories. The `-type f` option ensures that only files are considered, and the `-size +100M` option filters files larger than 100MB. The `-exec` option is used to execute the `mv` command to move the files to the `large_files` directory.<|endoftext|>
