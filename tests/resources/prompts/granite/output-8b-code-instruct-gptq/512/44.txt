Question:
Write a Go function that implements a concurrent file downloader. The function should download multiple files in parallel, with each file being downloaded in chunks using goroutines.


Answer:
Here's an example implementation of a concurrent file downloader in Go:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"net/http"
	"os"
	"sync"
)

func downloadFile(url, filename string, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done()

	resp, err := http.Get(url)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error downloading file:", err)
		return
	}
	defer resp.Body.Close()

	out, err := os.Create(filename)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error creating file:", err)
		return
	}
	defer out.Close()

	_, err = io.Copy(out, resp.Body)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error copying file:", err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println("File downloaded:", filename)
}

func main() {
	urls := []string{
		"https://example.com/file1.txt",
		"https://example.com/file2.txt",
		"https://example.com/file3.txt",
	}

	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	for _, url := range urls {
		wg.Add(1)
		go downloadFile(url, "downloaded-"+url[len("https://example.com/"):], &wg)
	}

	wg.Wait()
}
```

This implementation uses the `net/http` package to download the files, and the `io` package to copy the downloaded data to a file. The `sync.WaitGroup` is used to wait for all goroutines to finish before exiting the program.<|endoftext|>
