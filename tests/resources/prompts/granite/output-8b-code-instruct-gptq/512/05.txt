Question:
Write a context manager in Python that logs the start and end time of any block of code executed within its context.


Answer:
Here's how you can implement a context manager in Python that logs the start and end time of any block of code executed within its context:

```python
import time

class TimeLogger:
    def __enter__(self):
        self.start_time = time.time()
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        end_time = time.time()
        elapsed_time = end_time - self.start_time
        print(f"Elapsed time: {elapsed_time} seconds")
```<|endoftext|>
