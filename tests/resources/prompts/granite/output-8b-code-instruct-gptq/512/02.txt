Question:
In bash, how do I list all directories and sub-directories which contain a .py file.


Answer:
To list all directories and sub-directories in a bash shell that contain a .py file, you can use the following command:

```bash
find . -type d -exec sh -c 'if [ -e "$0/.py" ]; then echo "$0"; fi' sh {} +
```

This command uses the `find` command to search for directories (`-type d`) starting from the current directory (`.`). The `-exec` option is used to execute a command for each directory found. The command inside the `find` command checks if the directory contains a .py file using the `-e` flag. If the .py file is found, the directory path is printed using `echo`.

Note that the `sh -c` part is used to ensure that the command inside the `find` command is executed in a subshell. This is necessary because the `-exec` option expects a command to be executed for each directory found.<|endoftext|>
