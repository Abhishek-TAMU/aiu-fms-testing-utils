Question:
Implement a Python metaclass that modifies the creation of classes by automatically adding a method `describe()` to any class that uses this metaclass. The `describe()` method should return a string with the class name.


Answer:
Here's how you can implement this metaclass:

```python
class DescribeMetaclass(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, attrs):
        attrs['describe'] = lambda self: f'This is a {name} instance'
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, attrs)
