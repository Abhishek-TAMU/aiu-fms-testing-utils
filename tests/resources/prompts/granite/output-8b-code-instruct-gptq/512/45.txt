Question:
Write a Bash script that monitors a directory for changes (file creation, deletion, or modification) and logs each event with a timestamp into a log file.


Answer:
Here's an example Bash script that monitors a directory for changes and logs each event with a timestamp into a log file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set the directory to monitor
directory="/path/to/directory"

# Set the log file
log_file="/path/to/log/file"

# Create the log file if it doesn't exist
touch $log_file

# Monitor the directory for changes
while true
do
    # Get the current timestamp
    timestamp=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

    # Get the list of files in the directory
    files=$(ls -l $directory)

    # Log the list of files
    echo "$timestamp: $files" >> $log_file

    # Sleep for 1 second before checking again
    sleep 1
done
```

This script uses the `ls` command to get the list of files in the directory and the `date` command to get the current timestamp. It then logs the timestamp and the list of files into the log file using the `echo` command. The script runs in an infinite loop, checking for changes every second.<|endoftext|>
