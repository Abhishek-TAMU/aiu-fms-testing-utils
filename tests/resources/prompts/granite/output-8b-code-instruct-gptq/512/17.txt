Question:
Write a Rust program that reads a file line by line and prints each line reversed. Handle possible errors using Rust's `Result` and `Option` types.


Answer:
```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{BufRead, BufReader};
use std::io;

fn main() {
    let filename = "input.txt";
    let file = File::open(filename).expect("Unable to open file");
    let reader = BufReader::new(file);

    for line in reader.lines() {
        let line = line.expect("Unable to read line");
        let reversed = line.chars().rev().collect::<String>();
        println!("{}", reversed);
    }
}
