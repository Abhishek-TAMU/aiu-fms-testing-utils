Question:
Create a custom exception class in Python called `InvalidAgeError`. Write a function that raises this exception when an input age is less than 0 or greater than 120, with a message explaining the error.


Answer:
Here's how you can implement this:

```python
class InvalidAgeError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message):
        super().__init__(message)

def validate_age(age):
    if age < 0 or age > 120:
        raise InvalidAgeError("Age must be between 0 and 120.")
```

This implementation creates a custom exception class called `InvalidAgeError` that inherits from the built-in `Exception` class. The `__init__` method of the custom exception class takes a message as an argument and passes it to the parent class's `__init__` method.

The `validate_age` function takes an age as an argument and raises an `InvalidAgeError` if the age is less than 0 or greater than 120.<|endoftext|>
