Solve the following coding problem. Wrap your code answer using ```


Question:
Create a Python program that performs post-training quantization on a neural network and compares the accuracy of the quantized model with the original floating-point model.


Answer:
Here's an example of how you can perform post-training quantization on a neural network using TensorFlow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the original floating-point model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('original_model.h5')

# Convert the model to a quantized model
quantized_model = tf.keras.quantize.quantize_apply(model)

# Evaluate the accuracy of the original model
original_accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)

# Evaluate the accuracy of the quantized model
quantized_accuracy = quantized_model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)

# Print the accuracy of the original and quantized models
print('Original model accuracy:', original_accuracy)
print('Quantized model accuracy:', quantized_accuracy)
```

In this example, we first load the original floating-point model using `tf.keras.models.load_model`. Then, we use `tf.keras.quantize.quantize_apply` to convert the model to a quantized model. Finally, we evaluate the accuracy of both the original and quantized models using `model.evaluate` and compare the results.<|endoftext|>
