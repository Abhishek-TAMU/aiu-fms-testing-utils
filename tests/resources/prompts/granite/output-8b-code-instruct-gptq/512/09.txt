Question:
Implement a Python function using `asyncio` to make multiple asynchronous web requests and return the first successful response, cancelling the rest.


Answer:
Here's how you can implement this function:

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def make_async_requests(urls):
    tasks = [
        asyncio.create_task(aiohttp.request('GET', url))
        for url in urls
    ]
    responses = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    for response in responses:
        if response.status == 200:
            return response
    return None
