Question:
Write a Python script that defines a PyTorch neural network, trains it on a small dataset, and compares the training speed before and after applying `torch.compile()`.


Answer:
Here's an example of how you can write a Python script to define a PyTorch neural network, train it on a small dataset, and compare the training speed before and after applying `torch.compile()`:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import time

# Define the neural network
class NeuralNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(NeuralNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        out = self.fc1(x)
        out = self.relu(out)
        out = self.fc2(out)
        return out

# Create an instance of the neural network
input_size = 1000
hidden_size = 100
output_size = 10
model = NeuralNetwork(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)

# Define the loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Train the neural network
num_epochs = 10
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    start_time = time.time()
    # Forward pass
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

    # Backward pass
    loss.backward()

    # Update weights
    optimizer.step()

    # Print training time
    end_time = time.time()
    training_time = end_time - start_time
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}: Training time = {training_time} seconds")

# Compile the neural network using torch.compile()
compiled_model = torch.compile(model)

# Train the compiled neural network
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    start_time = time.time()
    # Forward pass
    outputs = compiled_model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

    # Backward pass
    loss.backward()

    # Update weights
    optimizer.step()

    # Print training time
    end_time = time.time()
