Question:
Use JAX to implement a 2D convolution operation manually, without using any deep learning library. Write a function that convolves a 2D image with a given kernel and returns the resulting feature map.


Answer:
Here's how you can implement a 2D convolution operation manually using JAX:

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp

def conv2d(image, kernel):
    m, n = image.shape
    k, l = kernel.shape
    feature_map = jnp.zeros((m - k + 1, n - l + 1))

    for i in range(m - k + 1):
        for j in range(n - l + 1):
            feature_map[i, j] = jnp.sum(image[i:i+k, j:j+l] * kernel)

    return feature_map
