Question:
Create a Bash script that compresses all `.txt` files in a directory into a `.zip` file, but excludes files that are larger than 1MB.


Answer:
Here's an example Bash script that compresses all `.txt` files in a directory into a `.zip` file, but excludes files that are larger than 1MB:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set the directory to compress
directory="/path/to/directory"

# Create a temporary directory to store the compressed files
temp_dir=$(mktemp -d)

# Loop through all .txt files in the directory
for file in $directory/*.txt; do
    # Check if the file is larger than 1MB
    if [ $(wc -c < $file) -le 1048576 ]; then
        # Compress the file and store it in the temporary directory
        zip -j $temp_dir/compressed_files.zip $file
    fi
done

# Create a .zip file containing all compressed files
zip -j $directory/compressed_files.zip $temp_dir/*.zip

# Remove the temporary directory
rm -rf $temp_dir
```

This script uses the `zip` command to compress the files. It first creates a temporary directory to store the compressed files, then loops through all `.txt` files in the specified directory. For each file, it checks if the file is larger than 1MB using the `wc` command. If the file is smaller than 1MB, it compresses the file using the `zip` command and stores it in the temporary directory. Finally, it creates a `.zip` file containing all compressed files in the specified directory and removes the temporary directory.<|endoftext|>
