Question:
Write a Python decorator that caches the results of a function call based on its arguments, and returns the cached result for future calls with the same arguments.


Answer:
Here's how you can implement a decorator that caches the results of a function call based on its arguments:

```python
def cache_results(func):
    cache = {}

    def wrapper(*args):
        if args not in cache:
            cache[args] = func(*args)
        return cache[args]

    return wrapper
