Solve the following coding problem. Wrap your code answer using ```


Question:
Write a Python function that uses `functools.lru_cache` to memoize the results of the Fibonacci sequence for faster computation of large numbers.


Answer:
Here's how you can implement this:

```python
import functools

@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
```

This implementation uses the `functools.lru_cache` decorator to cache the results of the Fibonacci sequence. The `maxsize` parameter is set to `None` to allow unlimited caching.<|endoftext|>
