Question:
Write a JAX program that demonstrates vectorized operations by performing element-wise addition, multiplication, and exponentiation on two large arrays using `jax.numpy`.


Answer:
Here is a JAX program that demonstrates vectorized operations:

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp

# Define two large arrays
a = jnp.arange(100000)
b = jnp.arange(100000)

# Perform element-wise addition
c = a + b

# Perform element-wise multiplication
d = a * b

# Perform element-wise exponentiation
e = jnp.power(a, b)

# Print the results
print(c)
print(d)
print(e)
