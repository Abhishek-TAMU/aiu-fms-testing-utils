Question:
Write a Python program that uses the `multiprocessing` library to create a pool of worker processes that calculate the factorial of numbers in a large list concurrently.


Answer:
Here's an example of how you can use the `multiprocessing` library to create a pool of worker processes that calculate the factorial of numbers in a large list concurrently:

```python
import multiprocessing

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

def calculate_factorial(numbers):
    pool = multiprocessing.Pool()
    results = pool.map(factorial, numbers)
    pool.close()
    pool.join()
    return results

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
results = calculate_factorial(numbers)
print(results)
```

In this example, we define a `factorial` function that calculates the factorial of a given number. We then define a `calculate_factorial` function that takes a list of numbers as input and uses the `multiprocessing.Pool` class to create a pool of worker processes. The `map` method is used to apply the `factorial` function to each number in the list concurrently. Finally, the results are returned and printed.<|endoftext|>
