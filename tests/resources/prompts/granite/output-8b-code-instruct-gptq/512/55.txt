Question:
Write a Bash script that accepts a list of filenames as input, checks if each file is writable, and if so, appends a timestamp to the end of each file.


Answer:
Here's a Bash script that accomplishes this task:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for file in "$@"
do
    if [ -w "$file" ]
    then
        timestamp=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S")
        echo "Appending timestamp to $file"
        echo "$timestamp" >> "$file"
    else
        echo "File $file is not writable"
    fi
done
```

This script uses a `for` loop to iterate over each file in the input list. For each file, it checks if the file is writable using the `-w` test. If the file is writable, it appends a timestamp to the end of the file using the `date` command and the `>>` redirection operator. If the file is not writable, it prints an error message.<|endoftext|>
