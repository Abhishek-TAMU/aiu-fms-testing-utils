Question:
Write a function in JavaScript that debounces an input function such that it's only called once, after the input has stopped being called for a specific delay (e.g., for implementing searc bar auto-suggestions).


Answer:
Here's how you can implement this:

```javascript
function debounce(func, delay) {
  let timer;
  return function() {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => func.apply(this, arguments), delay);
  };
}
