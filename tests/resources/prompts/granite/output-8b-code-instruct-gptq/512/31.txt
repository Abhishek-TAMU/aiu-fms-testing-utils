Question:
Write a Python script that fine-tunes a pre-trained BERT model from the HuggingFace library on a text classification dataset, such as the IMDb movie reviews dataset.


Answer:
Here's an example of how you can fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model on the IMDb movie reviews dataset using the HuggingFace library:

```python
import torch
from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification, BertTokenizer

# Load the pre-trained BERT model
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Load the IMDb movie reviews dataset
# You can use the torchtext library to load the dataset

# Tokenize the text using the BERT tokenizer
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
tokenized_text = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt')

# Forward pass through the model
output = model(**tokenized_text)

# Compute the loss and perform backpropagation
loss = output.loss
loss.backward()

# Update the model's parameters
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=1e-5)
optimizer.step()
```

In this example, we first load the pre-trained BERT model from the HuggingFace library. Then, we load the IMDb movie reviews dataset and tokenize the text using the BERT tokenizer. We then forward pass through the model to compute the loss and perform backpropagation. Finally, we update the model's parameters using an optimizer.

Note that this is just a simplified example, and you may need to modify it to fit your specific use case.<|endoftext|>
