Question:
Write a context manager in Python that logs the start and end time of any block of code executed within its context.


Answer:
Here's an example of a context manager that logs the start and end time of any block of code executed within its context:

```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def __enter__(self):
        self.start = time.time()
        return self

    def __exit__(self, *args):
        self.end = time.time()
        self.elapsed_time = self.end - self.start
        print(f"{self.name} took {self.elapsed_time:.2f} seconds to complete.")

with Timer("My Timer"):
    # Code to be timed goes here
    time.sleep(1)
```

In this example, the Timer class is a context manager that logs the start and end time of any block of code executed within its context. The __enter__ and __exit__ methods are called automatically by the with statement when the context manager is used. The elapsed time is calculated and printed at the end of the block.<|endoftext|>
