Solve the following coding problem. Wrap your code answer using ```


Question:
Write a program in Rust that implements a simple producer-consumer problem using channels, where multiple producers send data to a consumer that processes it asynchronously.


Answer:
```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

    let tx_clone = tx.clone();
    thread::spawn(move || {
        for i in 0..10 {
            tx_clone.send(i).unwrap();
            println!("Producer sent: {}", i);
        }
    });

    thread::spawn(move || {
        for i in rx {
            println!("Consumer received: {}", i);
        }
    });

    thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(1));
}
