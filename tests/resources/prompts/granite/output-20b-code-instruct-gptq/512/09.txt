Question:
Implement a Python function using `asyncio` to make multiple asynchronous web requests and return the first successful response, cancelling the rest.


Answer:
```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def fetch(session, url):
    async with session.get(url) as response:
        return await response.text()

async def main():
    urls = [
        'https://httpbin.org/delay/1',
        'https://httpbin.org/delay/2',
        'https://httpbin.org/delay/3',
    ]

    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = [asyncio.create_task(fetch(session, url)) for url in urls]
        done, pending = await asyncio.wait(tasks, return_when=asyncio.FIRST_COMPLETED)
        for task in done:
            print(task.result())

asyncio.run(main())
