# This script recursively searches for all files larger than 100MB within a given directory and moves them to a separate folder called `large_files`.

# Get the directory to search
read -p "Enter the directory to search: " directory

# Create the large_files directory if it doesn't exist
if [ ! -d "$directory/large_files" ]; then
  mkdir "$directory/large_files"
fi

# Search for files larger than 100MB within the directory
find "$directory" -size +100M -exec mv {} "$directory/large_files" \;

# Print a message to the user
echo "All files larger than 100MB have been moved to the large_files directory."
