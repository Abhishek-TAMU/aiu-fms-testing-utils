Solve the following coding problem. Wrap your code answer using ```


Question:
Write a JAX program that demonstrates vectorized operations by performing element-wise addition, multiplication, and exponentiation on two large arrays using `jax.numpy`.


Answer:
```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

# Generate two large arrays
a = jnp.random.normal(size=(1000000,))
b = jnp.random.normal(size=(1000000,))

# Element-wise addition
c = a + b

# Element-wise multiplication
d = a * b

# Element-wise exponentiation
e = a ** 2
