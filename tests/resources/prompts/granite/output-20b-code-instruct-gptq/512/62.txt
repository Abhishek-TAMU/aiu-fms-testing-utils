Question:
Use JAX to implement a 2D convolution operation manually, without using any deep learning library. Write a function that convolves a 2D image with a given kernel and returns the resulting feature map.


Answer:
import jax.numpy as jnp

def convolve_2d(image, kernel):
    """Convolves a 2D image with a given kernel and returns the resulting feature map.

    Args:
        image (jnp.ndarray): The input image, with shape (height, width).
        kernel (jnp.ndarray): The kernel, with shape (kernel_height, kernel_width).

    Returns:
        jnp.ndarray: The resulting feature map, with shape (height, width).

    Example:
        >>> image = jnp.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
        >>> kernel = jnp.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
        >>> convolve_2d(image, kernel)
        DeviceArray([[ 9, 12],
                     [21, 28]], dtype=int32)

    # TODO: Implement the 2D convolution operation manually, without using any deep learning library.
    # Hint: You can use jnp.convolve() to perform the convolution operation.
    # Hint: You can use jnp.pad() to pad the image with zeros before convolving.
    # Hint: You can use jnp.sum() to sum the elements of the resulting feature map.
    # Hint: You can use jnp.expand_dims() and jnp.squeeze() to reshape the image and kernel.
    # Hint: You can use jnp.flip() to flip the kernel.
