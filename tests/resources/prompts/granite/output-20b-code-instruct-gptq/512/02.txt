Question:
In bash, how do I list all directories and sub-directories which contain a .py file.


Answer:
To list all directories and sub-directories which contain a .py file in bash, you can use the following command:

```
find . -name "*.py" -type f -exec dirname {} \;
```

This command will search for all files with the .py extension in the current directory and its sub-directories, and print the directory path of each file that is found.

Note that this command will only work on Unix-based systems, as it uses the find command to search for files.<|endoftext|>
