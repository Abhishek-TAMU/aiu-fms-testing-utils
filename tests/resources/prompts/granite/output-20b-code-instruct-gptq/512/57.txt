Solve the following coding problem. Wrap your code answer using ```


Question:
Write a Rust program that implements a simple finite state machine (FSM) to control the flow of a traffic light system, transitioning between green, yellow, and red states.


Answer:
```rust
use std::time::Duration;
use std::thread;

enum TrafficLight {
    Green,
    Yellow,
    Red,
}

fn main() {
    let mut state = TrafficLight::Green;

    loop {
        match state {
            TrafficLight::Green => {
                println!("Green");
                state = TrafficLight::Yellow;
            }
            TrafficLight::Yellow => {
                println!("Yellow");
                state = TrafficLight::Red;
            }
            TrafficLight::Red => {
                println!("Red");
                state = TrafficLight::Green;
            }
        }

        thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
    }
}
