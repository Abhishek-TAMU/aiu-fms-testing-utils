### Response:

Dear User,

Thank you for reaching out to us with your question. The expression "Long time no see" is a common idiom that has an interesting history. It is believed to have originated from the Chinese language, where it was used as a greeting between people who had not seen each other for a long time. The phrase roughly translates to "It has been a long time since we last saw each other."

The expression gained popularity in the United States during World War II, when American soldiers stationed in China would use it as a way to greet their Chinese counterparts. Over time, it became a common phrase used among soldiers and eventually spread to the general public.

Today, "Long time no see" is used as a way to acknowledge someone you haven't seen in a while, and is often used as a friendly greeting. It is a way of expressing that you are happy to see the person again and that you have missed them.

I hope this information helps you understand the origin and meaning of the expression "Long time no see." If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
