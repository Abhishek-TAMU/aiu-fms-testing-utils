### Instruction:
Discuss the influence of French existentialism on Albert Camus' `The Stranger`

### Response:

Dear User,

Thank you for your request. In `The Stranger`, Albert Camus' protagonist, Meursault, is a symbol of the absurdity and meaninglessness that French existentialism often explores. Meursault's actions and decisions are often arbitrary, and his lack of emotion or attachment to the world around him reflects the existentialist belief that life has no inherent meaning.

Furthermore, Camus' use of language and narrative structure in `The Stranger` also reflects the existentialist influence. The novel's use of simple, direct language and its rejection of flowery, poetic language is a reflection of the existentialist belief in the importance of individual experience and the rejection of societal norms and expectations.

Additionally, the novel's themes of alienation, freedom, and the absurd are all central to existentialist thought. Meursault's sense of alienation from the world around him, his freedom to make his own choices and create his own meaning, and the absurdity of the events that unfold are all explored in the context of existentialist philosophy.

Overall, French existentialism had a significant influence on Camus' `The Stranger`, and the novel remains a powerful example of the existentialist movement's impact on literature.

Thank you for your inquiry.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
