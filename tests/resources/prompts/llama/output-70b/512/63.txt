### Instruction:
Define the Pythagorean theorem and provide and example of how to use it in a real-world context

### Response:

The Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that describes the relationship between the sides of a right triangle. It states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

a^2 + b^2 = c^2

where a and b are the lengths of the other two sides, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.

One real-world context in which the Pythagorean theorem can be used is in architecture. For example, if an architect is designing a building with a sloping roof, they can use the Pythagorean theorem to determine the length of the rafters (the diagonal beams that support the roof).

Suppose the architect wants to design a building with a roof that slopes at an angle of 60 degrees. They can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the rafters, which will be the hypotenuse of a right triangle.

First, they need to determine the length of the other two sides of the triangle. Let's say the building is 20 feet wide, and the architect wants the rafters to be spaced 16 inches apart. This means the length of the other two sides of the triangle will be 20 feet / 16 inches per foot = 128 inches.

Now, they can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the rafters:

c^2 = a^2 + b^2
c^2 = 128^2 + 128^2
c^2 = 16384 + 16384
c^2 = 32768

Taking the square root of both sides gives:

c = sqrt(32768)
c = 180.3 inches

So, the length of the rafters in this example would be approximately 180.3 inches.

I hope this helps to illustrate how the Pythagorean theorem can be used in a real-world context! Let me know if you have any other questions.
