### Instruction:
Explain how to solve a quadratic equation with an example

### Response:

Hello! Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that.

A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of degree two, meaning the highest power of the variable (usually x) is two. It has the general form:

ax^2 + bx + c = 0

Where a, b, and c are constants, and x is the variable. To solve a quadratic equation, there are several methods you can use:

1. Factoring: If the equation can be factored into the product of two binomials, you can solve it by setting each factor equal to zero and solving for x. For example, if the equation is x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0, you can factor it as (x + 3)(x + 2) = 0, and then solve for x by setting each factor equal to zero: x + 3 = 0 and x + 2 = 0.
2. Quadratic Formula: If the equation cannot be factored, you can use the quadratic formula to solve it. The quadratic formula is:

x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

Where a, b, and c are the coefficients of the quadratic equation. This formula will give you two solutions for the variable x.

Let's use the example of the quadratic equation x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 to illustrate how to use the quadratic formula. First, we'll identify the coefficients: a = 1, b = 5, and c = 6. Next, we'll plug these values into the quadratic formula:

x = (-5 ± √(5^2 - 4(1)(6))) / 2(1)
x = (-5 ± √(25 - 24)) / 2
x = (-5 ± √1) / 2
x = (-5 ± 1) / 2
x = -3 or x = 2

So, the solutions to the equation x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 are x = -3 and x = 2.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
