### Instruction:
Describe how to make a paper plane in five steps

### Response:

Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's a step-by-step guide on how to make a paper plane in five easy steps:

Step 1: Take a piece of paper and fold it in half lengthwise, so that one long edge meets the other.

Step 2: Unfold the paper and fold the two top corners down to the middle crease, making sure they're even and symmetrical.

Step 3: Fold the bottom corner of the paper up to the middle crease, making sure it's even with the top corners.

Step 4: Fold the two sides of the paper in towards the middle crease, so that they meet at the bottom corner.

Step 5: Take the top corner of the paper and fold it back towards you, creating a small triangle. This will act as the plane's tail.

And that's it! You now have a beautiful paper plane, ready to take flight. Just give it a gentle toss and watch it soar.

I hope this helps, and happy flying!
