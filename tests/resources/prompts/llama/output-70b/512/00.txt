### Response:

To prepare chicken soup for a family of four, follow these steps:

1. Gather the necessary ingredients:
	* 2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breast or thighs
	* 4 cups of chicken broth
	* 1 large onion, diced
	* 3 cloves of garlic, minced
	* 2 carrots, peeled and sliced
	* 2 celery stalks, sliced
	* 1 teaspoon of dried thyme
	* 1 teaspoon of dried basil
	* Salt and pepper, to taste
	* 2 tablespoons of olive oil
2. In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
3. Add the diced onion and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes.
4. Add the minced garlic and sauté for an additional 1-2 minutes.
5. Add the chicken to the pot and cook until browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes.
6. Add the chicken broth, diced carrots, sliced celery, thyme, basil, salt, and pepper to the pot. Stir to combine.
7. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are tender.
8. Remove the pot from the heat and let it cool for a few minutes.
9. Use an immersion blender to puree the soup until desired consistency is reached. Alternatively, you can transfer the soup to a blender and blend until smooth, then return it to the pot.
10. Serve the soup hot, garnished with chopped herbs or a sprinkle of paprika, if desired.

Enjoy your delicious homemade chicken soup!
