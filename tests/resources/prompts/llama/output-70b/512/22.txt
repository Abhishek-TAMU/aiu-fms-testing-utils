Dear User,

Thank you for reaching out to us with your request. Parasite, directed by Bong Joon-ho in 2019, is a South Korean dark comedy thriller film that tells the story of the Kims, a poor family who scheme their way into the lives of a wealthy family, the Parks.

The film begins with the Kims, who are struggling to make ends meet and are living in a cramped semi-basement apartment. The son, Ki-woo, is given the opportunity to pose as a tutor for the Parks' daughter, Da-hye, and soon, the entire Kim family becomes embroiled in a scheme to infiltrate the Parks' lives and exploit their wealth.

As the Kims become more entrenched in the Parks' lives, they begin to uncover dark secrets about the family and their relationships with each other. The film's tone shifts from comedy to thriller as the Kims' deception is threatened with exposure, and the Parks' true nature is revealed.

The film features a talented ensemble cast, including Song Kang-ho, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, and Park So-dam. It was widely acclaimed for its sharp social commentary, clever plot twists, and masterful direction.
