Baroque music, which emerged in the 17th century and continued until the mid-18th century, is characterized by its grandeur, ornateness, and complexity. It is often described as a style that aims to evoke emotions and create a sense of drama and tension. Some of the key features of Baroque music include the use of elaborate ornamentation, complex harmonies, and a strong sense of rhythm.

Three prominent composers from the Baroque period are:
