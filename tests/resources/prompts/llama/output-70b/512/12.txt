Describe the water cycle in simple terms for a 10-year old

### Response:

Hi there! I'd be happy to explain the water cycle in a way that's easy to understand for a 10-year old.

The water cycle is the journey that water takes as it moves around our planet. It's a little like a big circle that water follows as it goes from the ocean to the sky and back again.

First, the sun heats up the water in the ocean, lakes, and rivers, causing it to evaporate into the air. This is called evaporation. The water vapor rises up into the sky and forms clouds.

Next, the water vapor in the clouds gets cold and turns back into liquid water, forming droplets. This is called condensation. When there are enough droplets, they come together to form rain or snow.

When it rains or snows, the water falls back down to Earth, landing on the ground, plants, and buildings. Some of the water soaks into the ground, while some of it flows across the surface as runoff.

Finally, the water that soaked into the ground can seep back into rivers, lakes, and oceans, starting the cycle all over again.

So, that's the water cycle! It's a big circle that never ends, and it's really important for our planet because it helps keep everything healthy and growing.

I hope that helps you understand the water cycle a little better! Do you have any questions about it?
