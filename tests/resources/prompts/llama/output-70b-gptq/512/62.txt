### Instruction:
Compare the portrayal of heroism in `Beowulf` and `The Lord of the Rings`

### Response:

Dear User,

Thank you for your request. In `Beowulf`, the titular character is portrayed as a hero who embodies the values of Anglo-Saxon culture, such as courage, strength, and loyalty. He demonstrates these traits in his battles against Grendel and Grendel's mother, and his actions are motivated by a desire to protect his people and uphold his honor.

In `The Lord of the Rings`, the character of Frodo Baggins is also portrayed as a hero, but in a different way. Frodo's heroism is more subtle and nuanced, as he is not a warrior or a skilled fighter. Instead, he is a hobbit who is thrust into a dangerous quest to destroy the One Ring and save Middle-earth from the darkness of Sauron's rule. Frodo's heroism is shown in his willingness to sacrifice himself for the greater good, his bravery in the face of overwhelming danger, and his unwavering commitment to his quest.

Both Beowulf and Frodo are portrayed as heroes, but in different ways that reflect the values and themes of their respective stories. Beowulf's heroism is more traditional and physical, while Frodo's is more introspective and emotional.

I hope this helps you with your comparison of the portrayal of heroism in these two works. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
