### Response:

Dear User,

Thank you for reaching out to us with your question. The expression "Long time no see" is a common idiom that has its roots in the Chinese language. It is believed to have originated from the Cantonese phrase "hǎo jiào bù jiàn" (好久不见), which literally means "long time no see."

The phrase was popularized by Chinese immigrants who came to the United States in the 19th century. At that time, many Chinese immigrants came to the US to work on railroads and in mines, and they often lived and worked in isolation from their families and communities back in China. When they finally had the opportunity to return home or see their loved ones, they would say "long time no see" as a way of expressing the joy and excitement of reuniting after a long period of separation.

Over time, the phrase gained popularity among non-Chinese speakers, and it became a common expression used to greet someone whom one has not seen in a long time. It is often used as a way of expressing familiarity and warmth, and it is now widely used in many English-speaking countries.

We hope this information helps you understand the origin and meaning of the expression "Long time no see." If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

Best regards,
