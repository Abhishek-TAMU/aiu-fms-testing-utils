### Instruction:
Describe how to make a paper plane in five steps

### Response:

Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's a step-by-step guide on how to make a paper plane in five easy steps:

Step 1: Take a piece of paper and fold it in half lengthwise, so that one long edge meets the other.

Step 2: Unfold the paper and lay it flat with the folded edge facing you. Draw a line down the center of the paper, running from the top edge to the bottom edge.

Step 3: Fold the top left and right corners of the paper down so that they meet the line you drew in step 2. Make sure the corners are folded neatly and that the edges are aligned.

Step 4: Fold the bottom left and right corners of the paper up so that they meet the line again. Just like in step 3, make sure the corners are folded neatly and that the edges are aligned.

Step 5: Take the top edge of the paper and fold it back towards you, creating a small triangle. This will act as the nose of the plane.

And that's it! Your paper plane is now ready to fly. Gently toss it underhand to see how far it will glide.

I hope this helps you make a great paper plane. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please don't hesitate to ask!
