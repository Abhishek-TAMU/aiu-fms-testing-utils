The film explores themes of class struggle, social inequality, and the exploitation of the underprivileged.

The film begins with the Kim family, who are struggling to make ends meet and are living in a cramped semi-basement apartment.

One day, Ki-woo's friend, Min-hyuk, gives him a scholar's rock, which he claims will bring him good luck.

Posing as a university student, Ki-woo impresses the Parks with his fake credentials and is hired on the spot. He quickly becomes close to the family, especially the mother, Yeon-kyo, who is impressed by his supposed education and cultural knowledge.

As Ki-woo becomes more entrenched in the Parks' lives, he begins to manipulate them and exploit their trust. He convinces them to hire his sister, Ki-jung, as an art tutor for their son, Da-song, and she quickly becomes embroiled in their lives as well.
