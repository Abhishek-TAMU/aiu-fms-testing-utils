Describe the water cycle in simple terms for a 10-year old

### Response:

Hi there! I'd be happy to explain the water cycle in a way that's easy to understand. The water cycle is the journey that water takes as it moves around our planet.

Imagine you're a drop of water. You start out in the ocean, lake or river. You might be swimming around with other drops of water, or you might be sitting on the surface, enjoying the sunshine.

But then, something magical happens. You start to evaporate! That means you turn into water vapor, and you rise up into the air. You might feel a little lonely at first, but don't worry, you're not alone. There are lots of other water droplets up there with you.

As you rise higher and higher, you start to cool down and turn back into liquid water. You might form a cloud, or you might join up with other water droplets to make a big, juicy rain drop.

Eventually, you'll start to fall back down to Earth. You might land on a leaf, or you might splash into a puddle. And then, the magic happens all over again. You'll start to evaporate, and the cycle will start again.

So, that's the water cycle! It's a never-ending journey that water takes, all around our planet. And you, little drop of water, are a part of it all.
