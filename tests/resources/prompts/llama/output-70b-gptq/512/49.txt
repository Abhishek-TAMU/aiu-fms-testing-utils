Explore the theme of isolation in Marie Shelley's `Frankenstein`

### Response:

Dear User,

Thank you for your request. In `Frankenstein`, Mary Shelley explores the theme of isolation through the character of Victor Frankenstein and his creation, the monster.

Victor Frankenstein, a young scientist, becomes obsessed with creating life and isolates himself from society to pursue his goal. He spends years studying and experimenting, neglecting his family and friends. His isolation is further emphasized by his move to the remote Swiss Alps, where he finally succeeds in creating the monster.

The monster, however, is rejected by its creator and society, leading to its own isolation. The monster is forced to live in the wilderness, away from human contact, and is unable to form meaningful connections with others. It yearns for companionship and understanding but is constantly met with fear and hostility.

Through the characters of Victor and the monster, Shelley highlights the devastating consequences of isolation on the individual and society. She warns that isolation can lead to a sense of loneliness, despair, and even destruction.

I hope this information helps you understand the theme of isolation in `Frankenstein`. If you have any further questions or requests, please feel free to ask.

Best regards,
