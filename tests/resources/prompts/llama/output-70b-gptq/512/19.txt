### Instruction:
Describe the characteristics of Baroque music and name three prominent composers from that period

### Response:

Baroque music, which emerged in the 17th century and continued until the mid-18th century, is a style of music that is characterized by its grandeur, ornateness, and complexity. It is often described as a "maximalist" style, with elaborate ornamentation, complex harmonies, and a strong sense of drama and emotion.

Three prominent composers from the Baroque period are:

1. Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750) - A German composer and organist, Bach is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time. He wrote extensively for various instruments and vocal ensembles, and his music is known for its technical complexity and profound spiritual depth.
2. Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741) - An Italian composer and violinist, Vivaldi is best known for his concertos, particularly "The Four Seasons," which is one of the most popular pieces of music from the Baroque period. His music is characterized by its expressive melodies, vivid harmonies, and virtuosic solo passages.
3. George Frideric Handel (1685-1759) - A German-born British composer, Handel was a prominent figure in the London musical scene during the early 18th century. His music is known for its grandeur, drama, and sense of spectacle, and he is particularly famous for his operas, oratorios, and orchestral works.
