Of course! Here's a list of instructions for preparing chicken soup for a family of four:

Ingredients:

* 2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts
* 4 carrots, peeled and chopped
* 2 celery stalks, chopped
* 2 cloves of garlic, minced
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 4 cups of chicken broth

* 1 teaspoon of dried thyme
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* 2 tablespoons of olive oil

Instructions:

1. In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
2. Add the chopped onion and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes.
3. Add the minced garlic and sauté for an additional 1-2 minutes.
4. Add the chopped carrots and celery and sauté for 2-3 minutes, or until they begin to soften.
5. Add the chicken breasts to the pot and cook until browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes.
6. Pour in the chicken broth and water, and add the dried thyme. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
7. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are tender.
8. Remove the pot from the heat and let cool for a few minutes.
