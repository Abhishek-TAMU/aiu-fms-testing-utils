Compare the portrayal of heroism in `Beowulf` and `The Lord of the Rings`

### Response:
Hello! I'd be happy to help you compare the portrayal of heroism in `Beowulf` and `The Lord of the Rings`.

In `Beowulf`, the heroic ideal is portrayed through the character of Beowulf himself, who embodies the values of courage, strength, and selflessness. Beowulf risks his own life to save the kingdom of the Danes from the monster Grendel and later from Grendel's mother. His actions are motivated by a desire to prove his worth as a warrior and to gain fame and glory.

In `The Lord of the Rings`, the heroic ideal is portrayed through the character of Frodo, who embodies the values of courage, perseverance, and selflessness. Frodo risks his own life to destroy the One Ring and save Middle-earth from the darkness of Sauron's rule. His actions are motivated by a desire to do what is right and to protect his friends and fellow hobbits.

Both Beowulf and Frodo are portrayed as heroes who are willing to make sacrifices for the greater good, and both stories emphasize the importance of courage, loyalty, and selflessness in the face of danger and adversity. However, while Beowulf is portrayed as a more traditional hero who seeks glory and fame, Frodo is portrayed as a more reluctant hero who is driven by a sense of duty and a desire to do what is right.

I hope this comparison helps you in your studies! Let me know if you have any other questions.
