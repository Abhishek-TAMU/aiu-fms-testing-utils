### Instruction:
Explore the theme of isolation in Marie Shelley's `Frankenstein`

### Response:

Certainly! In Mary Shelley's classic novel `Frankenstein`, the theme of isolation is a prevalent and recurring motif that permeates throughout the story. The novel explores the consequences of isolation on both the creator and the created, as well as the blurred lines between the two.

One of the most prominent examples of isolation in the novel is Victor Frankenstein's own experience. As he becomes increasingly obsessed with his creation, he withdraws from his friends and family, shutting himself off from the world and neglecting his relationships. This isolation ultimately leads to his downfall, as he becomes consumed by his own guilt and regret.

Similarly, the creature itself is isolated by its very nature. Created as a monster, it is shunned and rejected by society, forced to live in solitude and loneliness. This isolation leads to a deep sense of longing and despair, as the creature yearns for human connection and understanding.

Furthermore, the novel also explores the idea of isolation as a result of scientific pursuit. Victor's obsessive desire to create life leads him down a dangerous path, one that ultimately isolates him from the world and from his own humanity. This theme serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked ambition and the importance of human connection.

Overall, Mary Shelley's `Frankenstein` is a powerful exploration of the theme of isolation, and the devastating consequences that can result from it.
