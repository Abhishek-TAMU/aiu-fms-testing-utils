### Response:
Hello! I'd be happy to help you understand the key differences between a parliamentary and a presidential system of government.

A parliamentary system of government is characterized by a few key differences from a presidential system. First, in a parliamentary system, the head of government is not directly elected by the people, but rather is chosen by the legislature. This means that the leader of the party or coalition that has the most seats in the legislature becomes the prime minister or premier.

In contrast, in a presidential system, the head of government is directly elected by the people and serves a fixed term, typically four or five years. The president is not responsible to the legislature and cannot be removed from office by the legislature except through impeachment.

Another key difference is that in a parliamentary system, the government is accountable to the legislature and can be removed from office by a vote of no confidence. In a presidential system, the president serves a fixed term and cannot be removed from office by the legislature except through impeachment.

Additionally, in a parliamentary system, the legislature is bicameral, meaning it consists of two houses, while in a presidential system, the legislature is unicameral, meaning it consists of one house.

Overall, the key differences between a parliamentary and a presidential system of government are the method of selecting the head of government, the accountability of the government to the legislature, and the structure of the legislature. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
