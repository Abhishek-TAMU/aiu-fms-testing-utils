### Response:
Hello! Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that. Parasite is a 2019 South Korean black comedy thriller film directed by Bong Joon-ho. The movie tells the story of two families, one poor and one wealthy, and their relationships with each other.

The film begins with the Park family, who are wealthy and live in a luxurious mansion. The family consists of father Ki-taek, mother Yeon-kyo, and their two children, Park Da-hye and Park Da-wi. Meanwhile, the Kims, who live in a cramped semi-basement apartment, are struggling financially. The family consists of father Kim Deok-hun, mother Kim Gook-hwan, and their son Kim Ki-woo.

One day, Ki-woo, who is a high school student, is offered a tutoring job by the Park family for their daughter Da-hye. Ki-woo successfully convinces the Parks that he is a university student, and he begins tutoring Da-hye. Soon after, Ki-woo's mother Gook-hwan becomes the Parks' housekeeper, and his father Deok-hun poses as a successful art dealer and becomes the Parks' chauffeur.

As the Kims continue to infiltrate the Parks' lives, they begin to uncover dark secrets about the family's past and their true intentions. The film takes a thrilling turn when the Kims' deception is revealed, and the two families are thrown into chaos.

Overall, Parasite is a thought-provoking and entertaining film that explores themes of class struggle, social inequality, and the exploitation of the underprivileged. I hope this summary helps you understand the plot of the movie! Is there anything else you'd like to know?
