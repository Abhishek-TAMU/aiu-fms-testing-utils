### Instruction:
Describe the difference between covalent and ionic bonds, with examples

### Response:
Hello! Sure, I'd be happy to help you understand the difference between covalent and ionic bonds.

Covalent bonds are chemical bonds that form when two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons in order to form a molecule. This type of bond is typically found in molecules that contain nonmetals, such as hydrogen (H2), oxygen (O2), and nitrogen (N2). Covalent bonds are strong and stable, and they are responsible for the structure and properties of most organic compounds.

Ionic bonds, on the other hand, are formed when one or more electrons are transferred from one atom to another, resulting in the formation of ions with opposite charges. This type of bond is typically found in compounds that contain metals and nonmetals, such as sodium chloride (NaCl) and table salt. Ionic bonds are strong and rigid, and they are responsible for the structure and properties of many inorganic compounds.

Here are some examples of covalent bonds:

* Hydrogen (H2)
* Oxygen (O2)
* Nitrogen (N2)
* Carbon dioxide (CO2)
* Methane (CH4)

Here are some examples of ionic bonds:

* Sodium chloride (NaCl)
* Calcium carbonate (CaCO3)
* Ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3)
* Aluminum sulfate (Al2(SO4)3)

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
