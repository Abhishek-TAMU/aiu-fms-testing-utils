### Response:
Hello! I'd be happy to help you with that. Baroque music, which spanned from approximately 1600 to 1750, is characterized by its grandeur, drama, and ornateness. It is often marked by complex harmonies, intricate melodies, and a strong sense of emotion. Some notable features of Baroque music include the use of counterpoint, the development of the concerto form, and the emergence of the solo instrumentalist.

Three prominent composers from the Baroque period are:

1. Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750) - A German composer and organist, Bach is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time. His music is known for its technical complexity, profound expressiveness, and deep spirituality.
2. Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741) - An Italian composer and violinist, Vivaldi is best known for his concertos, which feature technical virtuosity and expressive melodies. His music is often associated with the Venetian school of composition.
3. George Frideric Handel (1685-1759) - A German-born British composer, Handel is known for his operas, oratorios, and instrumental works. His music is characterized by its grandeur, drama, and technical mastery, and he is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of the Baroque period.
