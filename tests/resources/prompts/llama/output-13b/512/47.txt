### Instruction:
Discuss the influence of French existentialism on Albert Camus' `The Stranger`

### Response:
Hello! I'd be happy to help you with your question. French existentialism had a significant influence on Albert Camus' novel `The Stranger`, as Camus was heavily influenced by the ideas of existentialist philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Martin Heidegger.

One of the key themes of existentialism is the idea that human beings have complete freedom to choose their own path in life, and that there is no inherent meaning or purpose to existence. This idea is reflected in `The Stranger` through the character of Meursault, who is a detached and unemotional protagonist who makes choices based on his own desires and impulses, rather than conforming to societal expectations.

Another important aspect of existentialism is the concept of the "absurd," which refers to the idea that human beings are often faced with situations that are inherently meaningless or irrational. Camus' novel explores this idea through Meursault's experiences, as he navigates a seemingly meaningless and absurd world.

Overall, the influence of French existentialism on `The Stranger` is evident in the novel's themes of freedom, choice, and the absurd, and in the character of Meursault, who embodies the existentialist ideals of individualism and self-determination.
