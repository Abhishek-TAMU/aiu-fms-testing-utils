Define the term `Artificial Intelligence` in simple language

### Response:
Hello! Sure, I'd be happy to help define the term `Artificial Intelligence` in simple language.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines or computers to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. In other words, AI is when machines can think and act like humans, but without the need for human intervention.

For example, AI can be used in self-driving cars to enable them to recognize and respond to different road conditions and obstacles, or in virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa to understand and respond to voice commands.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
