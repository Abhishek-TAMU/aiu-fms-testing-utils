Explain the difference between procedural programming and object-oriented programming

### Response:
Hello! I'd be happy to help you understand the difference between procedural programming and object-oriented programming.

Procedural programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on the steps or procedures that a program should follow to perform a task. In procedural programming, the program is designed as a set of linear, sequential steps that are executed one at a time. This means that the program is organized around a set of functions or procedures that perform specific tasks, and the program's logic is focused on the steps required to complete each task.

Object-oriented programming (OOP), on the other hand, is a programming paradigm that focuses on the concept of objects, which are instances of classes that represent real-world entities or concepts. In OOP, programs are designed around objects and their interactions, rather than around procedures or functions. This means that OOP programs are organized around objects and their properties and methods, and the program's logic is focused on the interactions between objects.

One key difference between procedural programming and OOP is the way that programs are structured. Procedural programs are typically organized as a series of linear steps, while OOP programs are organized around objects and their interactions. This means that OOP programs can be more modular and flexible than procedural programs, as objects can be easily reused and combined in different ways to perform different tasks.

Another key difference is the way that programs handle data. In procedural programming, data is typically stored in global variables or passed as arguments to functions. In OOP, data is stored within objects and is accessed through methods that operate on that data. This means that OOP programs can be more robust and easier to maintain, as data is encapsulated within objects and is less prone to changes or errors.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
