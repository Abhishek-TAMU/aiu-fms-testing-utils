### Response:

Hello! I'd be happy to help you compare the portrayal of heroism in `Beowulf` and `The Lord of the Rings`.

In `Beowulf`, the heroic ideal is portrayed through the character of Beowulf himself, who embodies the values of courage, strength, and selflessness. Beowulf's actions are motivated by a desire to protect his people and fight against evil, even if it means putting his own life at risk. The poem also highlights the importance of loyalty and the value of a good reputation, as Beowulf's fame and reputation are central to his heroism.

In `The Lord of the Rings`, the heroic ideal is portrayed through the character of Frodo, who embodies the values of perseverance, self-sacrifice, and compassion. Frodo's journey is motivated by a desire to destroy the One Ring and save Middle-earth, even if it means facing dangerous challenges and making difficult choices. The novel also highlights the importance of friendship and the value of teamwork, as Frodo is aided by a group of loyal companions who support him on his quest.

Overall, both `Beowulf` and `The Lord of the Rings` portray heroism as a multifaceted concept that involves not only physical strength and bravery, but also emotional resilience, selflessness, and a strong sense of purpose. Both works also emphasize the importance of loyalty, friendship, and reputation in the development of heroic characters.
