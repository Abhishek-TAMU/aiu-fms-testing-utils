### Response:
Hello! I'd be happy to help you with that. Baroque music, which spanned from approximately 1600 to 1750, is characterized by its grandeur, drama, and ornateness. It is known for its complex harmonies, intricate melodies, and elaborate ornamentation.

Three prominent composers from the Baroque period are:

1. Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750) - A German composer and organist who is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the history of Western classical music. He composed works such as the "Mass in B minor" and the "Goldberg Variations."
2. Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741) - An Italian composer and violinist who is best known for his concertos, including "The Four Seasons."
3. George Frideric Handel (1685-1759) - A German-born British composer who is known for his operas, oratorios, and instrumental works, including "Messiah" and "Water Music."
