### Instruction:
Explain how to solve a quadratic equation with an example

### Response:
Hello! Sure, I'd be happy to help you understand how to solve a quadratic equation. A quadratic equation is a type of equation that has the form:

ax^2 + bx + c = 0

where a, b, and c are constants. To solve a quadratic equation, there are several methods you can use, but one common method is to use factoring.

Let's consider the example of the quadratic equation:

x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0

To solve this equation, we can start by factoring the left-hand side of the equation:

x^2 + 4x + 4 = (x + 2)^2 = 0

Now we can see that (x + 2) = 0, so x + 2 = 0.

Solving for x, we get:

x = -2

So, the solution to the equation is x = -2.

I hope this helps! Do you have any other questions about solving quadratic equations?
