### Response:
Hi there! I'd be happy to help you with that. Here's a list of instructions for preparing chicken soup for a family of four:

Ingredients:

* 2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts
* 4 cups of chicken broth
* 2 carrots, peeled and chopped
* 2 celery stalks, chopped
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 2 cloves of garlic, minced
* 1 teaspoon of dried thyme
* Salt and pepper to taste

Instructions:

1. In a large pot, combine the chicken broth, carrots, celery, onion, garlic, and thyme. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat.
2. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and add the chicken breasts to the pot.
3. Simmer the soup for 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are tender.
4. Remove the chicken from the pot and shred it into bite-sized pieces. Return the shredded chicken to the pot.
5. Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste.
6. Serve the soup hot, garnished with chopped herbs or a sprinkle of paprika.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you need any further assistance.
