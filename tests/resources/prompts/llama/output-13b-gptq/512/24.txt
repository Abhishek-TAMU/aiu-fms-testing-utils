Describe how to make a paper plane in five steps

### Response:
Hello! Sure, I'd be happy to help you learn how to make a paper plane in five steps. Here's how you can do it:

Step 1: Take a piece of paper and fold it in half lengthwise.

Step 2: Unfold the paper and fold the top left and right corners down to the middle crease.

Step 3: Fold the bottom left and right corners up to the middle crease, making sure the edges line up.

Step 4: Fold the top and bottom edges of the paper in towards the middle crease, so that they meet at the middle fold.

Step 5: Gently toss the paper plane into the air and watch it soar!

I hope this helps you make a great paper plane. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with. Happy folding!
