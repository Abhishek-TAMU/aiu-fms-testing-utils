Define the term `Artificial Intelligence` in simple language

### Response:
Hello! Sure, I'd be happy to help define the term `Artificial Intelligence` in simple language.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the use of computer systems and algorithms to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. In other words, AI is a way for machines to think and act like humans, but without the limitations of human physical abilities.

For example, AI can be used in self-driving cars to help them recognize and respond to different road conditions, or in virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa to help them understand and respond to voice commands.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
