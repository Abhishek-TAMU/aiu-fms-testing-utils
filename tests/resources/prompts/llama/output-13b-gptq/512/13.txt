### Response:
Hi there! Sure, here are five common ways to reduce stress:

1. Exercise: Regular physical activity can help reduce stress by releasing endorphins, which are natural mood-boosters. Try activities like walking, jogging, or yoga to get started.

2. Meditation: Mindfulness meditation can help calm your mind and reduce stress. You can find guided meditations online or through apps like Headspace or Calm.

3. Time management: Poor time management can lead to increased stress levels. Prioritize your tasks, set realistic deadlines, and take regular breaks to help manage your workload.

4. Social support: Spending time with loved ones can help reduce stress. Reach out to friends and family, or join a social club or group to meet new people.

5. Relaxation techniques: Activities like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and visualization can help calm your mind and body. You can find guided relaxation exercises online or through apps like Calm or Insight Timer.

Remember, everyone is different, so it's important to experiment with different techniques to find what works best for you. Take care!
