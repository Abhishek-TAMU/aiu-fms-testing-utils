### Response:
Hello! Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that. Parasite is a 2019 South Korean black comedy thriller film directed by Bong Joon-ho. The movie tells the story of the Kims, a poor family living in a cramped semi-basement apartment, who scheme their way into the lives of a wealthy family, the Parks, by posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals and infiltrating their lives as their housekeeper, art tutor, and English language teacher.

As the Kims become more entrenched in the Parks' lives, they begin to exploit their wealth and privilege, but their deception is eventually discovered, leading to a series of events that expose the dark underbelly of class struggle and social inequality. The film explores themes of capitalism, social class, and the exploitation of the underprivileged, all set against a backdrop of dark humor and satire.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
