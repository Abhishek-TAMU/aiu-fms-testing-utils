### Instruction:
Describe the water cycle in simple terms for a 10-year old

### Response:
Hi there! The water cycle is like a big circle that water goes through in nature. It starts high in the sky where the sun heats up the water and makes it turn into water vapor. This water vapor rises up into the air and forms clouds. When the clouds get too full of water, they start to fall to the ground as rain or snow. When the rain or snow hits the ground, it can do a few things. Some of it might soak into the ground and help plants grow, or it might flow across the surface and fill up lakes and rivers. Eventually, the water might even evaporate again and go back up into the sky to start the cycle all over again! So, the water cycle is like a big circle that never ends.
