### Instruction:
Explain how inflation affects purchasing power and economic stability

### Response:
Inflation refers to the sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. When inflation occurs, the purchasing power of a unit of currency (e.g. dollar) decreases, meaning that the same amount of money can buy fewer goods and services than before. For example, if inflation is 2%, then a product that cost $100 last year will cost $102 this year.

Inflation can have both positive and negative effects on an economy. On the one hand, low levels of inflation can stimulate economic growth by encouraging spending and investment. On the other hand, high levels of inflation can erode purchasing power and reduce economic stability, leading to uncertainty and instability in financial markets.

To mitigate the negative effects of inflation, central banks often use monetary policy tools, such as raising interest rates, to reduce the money supply and curb inflation. However, raising interest rates can also have negative effects on economic growth, so central banks must carefully balance these competing goals.

In conclusion, inflation can have significant effects on purchasing power and economic stability, and central banks must carefully manage monetary policy tools to maintain a healthy balance between these competing goals.
