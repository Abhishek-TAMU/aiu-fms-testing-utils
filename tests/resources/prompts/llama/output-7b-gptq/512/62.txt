### Response:
Thank you for reaching out! Comparing the portrayal of heroism in `Beowulf` and `The Lord of the Rings` is a fascinating topic. Both works feature heroes who embody courage, loyalty, and selflessness, but there are also some notable differences.

In `Beowulf`, the hero Beowulf is depicted as a strong and fearless warrior who battles monsters and saves his people from danger. He is driven by a desire for fame and glory, and his actions are often motivated by a sense of duty to his lord and his people. However, as the poem progresses, it becomes clear that Beowulf's heroism is not without its flaws. He is often reckless and impulsive, and his desire for glory can lead him to make rash decisions.

In contrast, the heroes of `The Lord of the Rings` are more complex and nuanced. Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, and the other members of the Fellowship are driven by a sense of duty and a desire to save Middle-earth from the evil of Sauron. They are not motivated by a desire for personal glory, but rather by a sense of responsibility to their friends, their world, and their values. Their heroism is often quiet and unobtrusive, as they work together to achieve their goals through subtlety and strategy rather than through brawn and bravado.

Overall, both works offer unique and compelling portrayals of heroism, and they highlight the importance of courage, loyalty, and selflessness in the face of danger and adversity. Thank you for bringing this topic to my attention!
