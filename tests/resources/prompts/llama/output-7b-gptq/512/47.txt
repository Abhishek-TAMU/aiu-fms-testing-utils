### Instruction:
Discuss the influence of French existentialism on Albert Camus' `The Stranger`

### Response:
Thank you for reaching out! French existentialism had a profound impact on Albert Camus' writing, including his novel `The Stranger`. Camus was heavily influenced by the works of Jean-Paul Sartre and other French existentialist philosophers, who emphasized individual freedom and choice.

In `The Stranger`, Camus explores the theme of alienation and the absurdity of modern life through the eyes of the protagonist, Meursault. Meursault's disconnection from society and his inability to find meaning in his life are reflective of the existentialist philosophy, which rejects traditional notions of morality and instead emphasizes individual freedom and choice.

Camus' use of language and imagery in the novel also reflects the existentialist influence. For example, Meursault's observations of the sun-drenched beach and the sea are often described in vivid, sensory detail, emphasizing the beauty and absurdity of the natural world.

Overall, the influence of French existentialism on `The Stranger` is evident throughout the novel, and it adds depth and complexity to Camus' exploration of the human condition. Thank you for asking!
