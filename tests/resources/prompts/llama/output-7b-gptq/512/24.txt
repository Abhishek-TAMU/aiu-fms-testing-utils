### Instruction:
Describe how to make a paper plane in five steps

### Response:
Sure, here are the steps to make a basic paper plane:

Step 1: Take a piece of paper and fold it in half lengthwise. Unfold it and fold the two top corners down to the middle crease. This will create the wings of your plane.

Step 2: Fold the bottom of the paper up to the middle crease, creating a small triangle. This will be the tail of your plane.

Step 3: Fold the remaining part of the paper in half lengthwise again, and then fold the two sides in towards the middle crease. This will create the body of your plane.

Step 4: Take the wings and tail and attach them to the body of the plane using a small piece of tape or glue. Make sure the wings are securely attached and the tail is straight.

Step 5: Give your plane a gentle toss and watch it soar through the air!

I hope this helps you make a great paper plane! If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.
