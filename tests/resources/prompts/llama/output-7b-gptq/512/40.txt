### Response:
Thank you for reaching out! I'd be happy to help you compare the representation of dystopia in George Orwell's `1984`, Aldous Huxley's `Brave New World`, and Yevgeny Zamyatin's `We`.

Firstly, it's important to note that all three novels are considered classics of dystopian literature and offer unique insights into the dangers of totalitarianism, conformity, and the loss of individual freedom.
