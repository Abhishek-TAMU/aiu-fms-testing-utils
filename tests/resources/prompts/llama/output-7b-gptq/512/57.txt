### Instruction:
Explain the key differences between a parliamentary and a presidential system of government

### Response:
Thank you for reaching out! A parliamentary system of government is characterized by a single political party or coalition holding a majority of seats in the legislature, which in turn elects a prime minister. In contrast, a presidential system features an independent head of state who is elected through a direct election by the people.

In a parliamentary system, the prime minister is accountable to the legislature and can be removed by a vote of no confidence. In contrast, the president in a presidential system serves a fixed term and can only be removed through impeachment proceedings.

Another key difference is the distribution of power between the executive and legislative branches. In a parliamentary system, the prime minister and cabinet are responsible to the legislature and must maintain the confidence of the majority of legislators to remain in office. In a presidential system, the president has more independence and can veto legislative decisions, although the legislature can override the veto with a two-thirds majority.

I hope this helps clarify the key differences between these two systems of government! Let me know if you have any further questions.
