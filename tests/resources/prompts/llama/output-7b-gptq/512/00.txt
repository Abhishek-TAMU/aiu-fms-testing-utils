### Response:
Of course! Here are the steps to prepare chicken soup for a family of four:

1. Begin by placing 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add 1 teaspoon of chopped onion and sauté until softened, about 3-4 minutes.
2. Add 2 cloves of minced garlic and sauté for an additional 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.
3. Add 1 pound of diced chicken breast to the pot and cook until browned on all sides, about 5-6 minutes.
4. Pour in 4 cups of chicken broth and bring the mixture to a simmer.
5. Reduce heat to low and let the soup simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the soup has thickened slightly.
6. Use an immersion blender to puree the soup until smooth, or let it cool and puree it in a blender.
7. Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste.
8. Serve hot, garnished with chopped herbs or a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese.
