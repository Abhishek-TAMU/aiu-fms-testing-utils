### Instruction:
Explain how to solve a quadratic equation with an example

### Response:
Of course! Solving quadratic equations is a fundamental skill in algebra, and it's easy to do once you understand the process. A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of degree two, meaning the highest power of the variable (usually x) is two. The general form of a quadratic equation is:

ax^2 + bx + c = 0

where a, b, and c are constants, and x is the variable. To solve a quadratic equation, there are several methods you can use:

1. Factoring: If the equation can be factored into the product of two binomials, you can solve it by setting each factor equal to zero and solving for the variable. For example, if the equation is x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0, you can factor it as (x + 3)(x + 2) = 0, and then solve for x by setting each factor equal to zero: x + 3 = 0 and x + 2 = 0.
2. Quadratic Formula: If the equation cannot be factored, you can use the quadratic formula to solve it. The quadratic formula is:

x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

Where a, b, and c are the constants from the equation. This formula will give you two solutions for the variable x.

Let's use the example of the equation x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 to illustrate how to solve it using the quadratic formula. First, substitute the values of a, b, and c into the formula:

x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

x = (-5 ± √(5^2 - 4(1)(6))) / 2(1)

x = (-5 ± √(25 - 24)) / 2

x = (-5 ± √3) / 2

x = -3 or x = 1

So, the solutions to the equation are x = -3 and x = 1.

I hope this helps you understand how to solve quadratic equations! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
