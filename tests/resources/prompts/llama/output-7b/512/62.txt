### Response:
Thank you for reaching out! I'd be happy to help you compare the portrayal of heroism in `Beowulf` and `The Lord of the Rings`.

Both works are considered classics in the realm of heroic literature, and they offer unique perspectives on what it means to be a hero. In `Beowulf`, the hero is often depicted as a warrior who embodies strength, courage, and loyalty. The poem highlights the importance of these qualities in the face of danger and adversity, and it often portrays the hero as a solitary figure who must confront evil alone.

In contrast, `The Lord of the Rings` presents a more complex and nuanced view of heroism. The novel features a diverse cast of characters who embody different aspects of heroism, from the brave and selfless actions of Frodo and Sam to the strategic and wise leadership of Gandalf. The work also explores the idea of heroism as a collective effort, highlighting the importance of community and cooperation in achieving great deeds.

Overall, both works offer valuable insights into the nature of heroism, and they demonstrate the enduring appeal of this timeless theme. I hope this comparison has been helpful! Let me know if you have any further questions.
