Thank you for reaching out! Parasite is a 2019 South Korean black comedy thriller film directed by Bong Joon-ho. The film follows two families, the Kims and the Parks, who become intertwined in a complex and darkly comedic way. The Kims, a poor family living in a cramped semi-basement apartment, scheme their way into the lives of the wealthy Parks, who seem to have it all. However, as the two families become more entangled, secrets and lies are revealed, leading to a shocking and unexpected conclusion. With sharp social commentary and masterful direction, Parasite has received widespread critical acclaim and won several awards, including the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. I hope this summary helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
