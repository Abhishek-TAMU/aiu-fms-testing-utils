### Response:
Thank you for reaching out! I'd be happy to help you with your request. Grassroots movements have played a crucial role in advancing civil rights and social justice systems throughout history. These movements have brought people together to challenge unjust laws and policies, advocate for marginalized communities, and push for systemic change.

Some examples of grassroots movements that have had a significant impact on civil rights and social justice include the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, the Anti-Apartheid Movement in South Africa, and the Arab Spring protests in the Middle East. These movements have used various tactics, such as nonviolent protests, boycotts, and community organizing, to bring attention to their causes and push for change.

In addition to these specific movements, grassroots efforts have also contributed to broader social justice movements, such as the fight against gender inequality, LGBTQ+ rights, and environmental justice. These movements have helped to create a more just and equitable society by challenging systems of oppression and advocating for the rights of marginalized communities.

Overall, grassroots movements have been essential in advancing civil rights and social justice systems, and they continue to play a vital role in shaping the world we live in today.
