### Instruction:
Explain how to solve a quadratic equation with an example

### Response:
Of course! A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of degree two, meaning the highest power of the variable (usually x) is two. To solve a quadratic equation, there are several methods you can use. One common method is factoring, which involves finding two numbers whose product is equal to the coefficient of the x^2 term, and whose sum is equal to the coefficient of the x term. Once you have factored the equation, you can set each factor equal to zero and solve for x.

For example, let's consider the quadratic equation:

x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0

To solve this equation, we can factor it as:

(x + 3)(x + 2) = 0

Now, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:

x + 3 = 0 --> x = -3

x + 2 = 0 --> x = -2

So, the solutions to the equation are x = -3 and x = -2.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
