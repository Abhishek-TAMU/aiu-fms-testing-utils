### Instruction:
Summarize the main differences between renewable and non-renewable energy sources

### Response:
Thank you for reaching out! Renewable energy sources are natural resources that can be replenished over time, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. Non-renewable energy sources, on the other hand, are finite resources that cannot be replenished once they are depleted, such as coal, oil, and natural gas.

One of the main differences between renewable and non-renewable energy sources is their sustainability. Renewable energy sources are sustainable because they can be replenished naturally, while non-renewable energy sources are finite and will eventually run out. Additionally, renewable energy sources typically have lower environmental impacts compared to non-renewable energy sources, as they produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants.

Another key difference between renewable and non-renewable energy sources is their cost. Renewable energy sources are often more expensive to produce and distribute compared to non-renewable energy sources, although the cost of renewable energy is decreasing over time as technology improves.

Overall, while both renewable and non-renewable energy sources have their advantages and disadvantages, renewable energy sources are generally considered to be more sustainable and environmentally friendly in the long term.
