Provide three reasons why exercise is important for overall health

### Response:
Of course! Exercise is essential for overall health and well-being. Here are three reasons why:

1. **Boosts Immune System**: Regular exercise helps to boost the immune system by increasing the production of white blood cells, which fight off infections and diseases. This can help to prevent illnesses and keep you healthy.
2. **Reduces Stress**: Exercise is a natural stress-reliever and can help to reduce anxiety and depression. It can also improve sleep quality, which is essential for overall health.
3. **Increases Energy**: Regular exercise can increase energy levels and reduce fatigue. This is because exercise improves cardiovascular health, increases muscle strength and endurance, and boosts metabolism.

I hope this helps to explain why exercise is so important for overall health! Let me know if you have any other questions.
