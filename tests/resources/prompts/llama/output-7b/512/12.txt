Describe the water cycle in simple terms for a 10-year old

### Response:
Hi there! Sure, I'd be happy to explain the water cycle in simple terms for a 10-year old! ðŸ˜Š

The water cycle is the journey water takes as it moves around our planet. Here's how it works:

First, the sun heats up the water in the oceans, lakes, and rivers, making it turn into water vapor. This is called evaporation.

Next, the water vapor rises up into the air and forms clouds. When there are enough water droplets in a cloud, they start to fall to the ground as rain or snow. This is called precipitation.

After the rain or snow falls, it flows across the land and into rivers, lakes, and oceans, where it starts the cycle again.

So, the water cycle is like a big circle that never ends! Water is always moving and changing, but it's always coming back to the same place. Isn't that cool? ðŸŒŠ

I hope that helps you understand the water cycle a little better! Do you have any questions? ðŸ¤”
