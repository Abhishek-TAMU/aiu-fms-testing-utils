### Instruction:
Discuss the influence of French existentialism on Albert Camus' `The Stranger`

### Response:
Thank you for reaching out! French existentialism had a profound influence on Albert Camus' novel `The Stranger`. Camus was heavily influenced by the works of Jean-Paul Sartre and other existentialist philosophers, who emphasized the idea that human beings have complete freedom to choose their own path in life. This idea is reflected in the protagonist of `The Stranger`, Meursault, who is a detached and unemotional young man who goes through life without any clear sense of purpose or meaning.

Camus also drew on the existentialist concept of "absurdity," which holds that human existence is inherently meaningless and absurd. Meursault's experiences and interactions with the world around him are often absurd and meaningless, highlighting the absurdity of life and the futility of human attempts to find meaning or purpose.

Furthermore, Camus' use of symbolism and imagery in `The Stranger` is also influenced by existentialist thought. For example, the sun and the sea are used as symbols of the absurdity and meaninglessness of life, while the character of Marie represents the possibility of human connection and meaning.

Overall, the influence of French existentialism on `The Stranger` is evident in its themes of absurdity, freedom, and the search for meaning in a seemingly meaningless world. Thank you for your question!
