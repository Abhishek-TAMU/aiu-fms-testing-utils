### Instruction:
Describe how to make a paper plane in five steps

### Response:
Of course! Here are the steps to make a basic paper plane:

Step 1: Take a piece of paper and fold it in half lengthwise. Unfold the paper and lay it flat with the folded edge facing you.

Step 2: Fold the top left and right corners of the paper down so they meet the middle crease. Then, fold the bottom left and right corners up so they meet the middle crease.

Step 3: Fold the top and bottom edges of the paper in towards the middle crease. Make sure the edges are even and the plane is starting to take shape.

Step 4: Fold the wings of the plane outwards by folding the left and right edges of the paper towards the middle crease. Make sure the wings are even and the same size.

Step 5: Give your plane a gentle toss and watch it soar!

I hope this helps you make a great paper plane! If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.
