Define the term `Artificial Intelligence` in simple language

### Response:

Thank you for reaching out! Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. AI systems use algorithms and machine learning techniques to analyze data, recognize patterns, and make predictions or decisions based on that data.

In simpler terms, AI is like a computer program that can think and act like a human, but faster and more accurately. It can help us solve complex problems, automate repetitive tasks, and make decisions based on large amounts of data.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
