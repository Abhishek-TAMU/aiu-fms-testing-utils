In this response, I have translated the English phrase "Good morning, how are you?" into the Spanish phrase "Buenos días, ¿cómo estás?" I have also translated the phrase "I am well, thank you" into "Estoy bien, gracias." Finally, I have translated the phrase "my plane just landed" into "mi avión solo aterrizó." I hope this helps!
